# Pokemon Memory Game

This is a Memory Card Game built for The Odin Project. The point of making this was to practice using useState and useEffect in React in order to update the User Interface and fetch data from Api's.
While building this I got more experience using Lodash which I used for its \_.shuffle array method to randomize the cards on the screen. I was also able to practice using Modals which were my game win screen and game lose screen.
